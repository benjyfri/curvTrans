% The \author macro works with any number of authors. There are two commands
% used to separate the names and addresses of multiple authors: \And and \AND.
%
% Using \And between authors leaves it to \LaTeX{} to determine where to break
% the lines. Using \AND forces a linebreak at that point. So, if \LaTeX{}
% puts 3 of 4 authors names on the first line, and the last on the second
% line, try using \AND instead of \And before the third author name.

\section{To the LaPoint}
\label{headings}

My Model is here

\subsection{Prepocessing: invariance}
Our model must be invariant to permutations, rotations and translations of the input point cloud. To achieve this we preprocess the input point cloud to achieve canonical order. 

Given a 3D point cloud $\mX \in \R^{N \times 3}$, we create a full undirected graph $\gG=(\gV, \mW)$ where $\gV=\{x_i\}_{i=1}^n$, $\mW = \{ e^{-|| \vx_i-\vx_j ||_2} |  \forall x_i,x_j \in \gV \}$. 
The graph Laplacian operator is defined as \( \mL = \Delta - \mW \in \mathbb{R}^{N \times N} \) where \( \Delta \in \mathbb{R}^{N \times N} \) is a diagonal matrix whose \( i \)-th diagonal entry \( \Delta_{ii} = \sum_{j=1}^{N} \emW_{i,j} \).
As shown by Belkin the eigenvector $\Phi\in \R^{N}$ of the smallest non-zero eigenvalue $\lambda$ such that $\mL \Phi = \lambda\Phi $ achieves "optimal embedding" - close points in the original embedding are encouraged to be close in the new embedding. We use this embedding to create a canonical order for our point cloud. We sort the eigenvector ${\Phi}$ by the absolute value of its entries which gives us a permutation matrix $\Pi \in \R^{N \times N}$. We use this permutation matrix to achieve canonical order of our point cloud  $\bar{\mX} = \Pi \mX$.

Given the laplacina matrix above $\mL$ we calculate the first m eigenvalues to use as input to our model $\{ \lambda_i\}_{i=2}^m $. We also calculate the second order 



Invariance proof:

let $\mX \in \R^{N\times3}$ be a 3D point cloud, let $\mP\in \R^{N\times N}$ be a permutation matrix, $\mR\in \R^{3\times3}$ a 3D rotation matrix, $\vt\in \R^{3}$ a 3D translation

Using basic algebra we get $||x_i-x_j||=||\mR (x_i-x_j)+\vt - \vt||=||(\mR {x_i}+\vt)-(\mR {x_j} +\vt)||$. Therefor for two 3D point clouds , $\mX$ and $\bar{\mX} = {\mX}{\mR}+\vt$ we get the same weight matrix $\emW_{i,j} = e^{-|| \vx_i-\vx_j ||}$ resulting in the same Laplacian resulting in the same ordering of the point cloud.

let $\mX$, and $\bar{\mX} = {\mP}{\mX}$ we get $\bar{\mW} = {\mP}{\mW}{\mP}^{-1}$, $\bar{\Delta} = {\mP}{\Delta}{\mP}^{-1}$ resulting in $\bar{\mL} = {\mP}{\mL}{\mP}^{-1}$. Which leads to $\bar{\mL}({\mP \Phi}) = {{\mP}{\mL}{\mP}^{-1}}({\mP \Phi}) = {\mP}{\mL}\Phi = {\mP}{\lambda}\Phi = {\lambda}({\mP}\Phi)$. Therefor $({\mP}\Phi)$, the original eigenvector permuted, is an eigenvector of $\bar{\mL}$ with the same eigenvalue $\lambda$. Consequently, if we chose to order  a point cloud by the absolute values of the first eigenvector of its laplacian we will always get the same canonical order.

\section{Citations, figures, tables, references}
\label{others}

These instructions apply to everyone, regardless of the formatter being used.

\subsection{Citations within the text}

Citations within the text should be based on the \texttt{natbib} package
and include the authors' last names and year (with the ``et~al.'' construct
for more than two authors). When the authors or the publication are
included in the sentence, the citation should not be in parenthesis using \verb|\citet{}| (as
in ``See \citet{Hinton06} for more information.''). Otherwise, the citation
should be in parenthesis using \verb|\citep{}| (as in ``Deep learning shows promise to make progress
towards AI~\citep{Bengio+chapter2007}.'').

The corresponding references are to be listed in alphabetical order of
authors, in the \textsc{References} section. As to the format of the
references themselves, any style is acceptable as long as it is used
consistently.

\subsection{Footnotes}

Indicate footnotes with a number\footnote{Sample of the first footnote} in the
text. Place the footnotes at the bottom of the page on which they appear.
Precede the footnote with a horizontal rule of 2~inches
(12~picas).\footnote{Sample of the second footnote}

\subsection{Figures}

All artwork must be neat, clean, and legible. Lines should be dark
enough for purposes of reproduction; art work should not be
hand-drawn. The figure number and caption always appear after the
figure. Place one line space before the figure caption, and one line
space after the figure. The figure caption is lower case (except for
first word and proper nouns); figures are numbered consecutively.

Make sure the figure caption does not get separated from the figure.
Leave sufficient space to avoid splitting the figure and figure caption.

You may use color figures.
However, it is best for the
figure captions and the paper body to make sense if the paper is printed
either in black/white or in color.
\begin{figure}[h]
\begin{center}
%\framebox[4.0in]{$\;$}
\fbox{\rule[-.5cm]{0cm}{4cm} \rule[-.5cm]{4cm}{0cm}}
\end{center}
\caption{Sample figure caption.}
\end{figure}

\subsection{Tables}

All tables must be centered, neat, clean and legible. Do not use hand-drawn
tables. The table number and title always appear before the table. See
Table~\ref{sample-table}.

Place one line space before the table title, one line space after the table
title, and one line space after the table. The table title must be lower case
(except for first word and proper nouns); tables are numbered consecutively.

\begin{table}[t]
\caption{Sample table title}
\label{sample-table}
\begin{center}
\begin{tabular}{ll}
\multicolumn{1}{c}{\bf PART}  &\multicolumn{1}{c}{\bf DESCRIPTION}
\\ \hline \\
Dendrite         &Input terminal \\
Axon             &Output terminal \\
Soma             &Cell body (contains cell nucleus) \\

\end{table}

\section{Final instructions}
Do not change any aspects of the formatting parameters in the style files.
In particular, do not modify the width or length of the rectangle the text
should fit into, and do not change font sizes (except perhaps in the
\textsc{References} section; see below). Please note that pages should be
numbered.

\section{Preparing PostScript or PDF files}

Please prepare PostScript or PDF files with paper size ``US Letter'', and
not, for example, ``A4''. The -t
letter option on dvips will produce US Letter files.

Consider directly generating PDF files using \verb+pdflatex+
(especially if you are a MiKTeX user).
PDF figures must be substituted for EPS figures, however.

Otherwise, please generate your PostScript and PDF files with the following commands:
\begin{verbatim}
dvips mypaper.dvi -t letter -Ppdf -G0 -o mypaper.ps
ps2pdf mypaper.ps mypaper.pdf
\end{verbatim}

\subsection{Margins in LaTeX}

Most of the margin problems come from figures positioned by hand using
\verb+\special+ or other commands. We suggest using the command
\verb+\includegraphics+
from the graphicx package. Always specify the figure width as a multiple of
the line width as in the example below using .eps graphics
\begin{verbatim}
   \usepackage[dvips]{graphicx} ...
   \includegraphics[width=0.8\linewidth]{myfile.eps}
\end{verbatim}
or % Apr 2009 addition
\begin{verbatim}
   \usepackage[pdftex]{graphicx} ...
   \includegraphics[width=0.8\linewidth]{myfile.pdf}
\end{verbatim}
for .pdf graphics.
See section~4.4 in the graphics bundle documentation (\url{http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/required/graphics/grfguide.ps})

A number of width problems arise when LaTeX cannot properly hyphenate a
line. Please give LaTeX hyphenation hints using the \verb+\-+ command.

\subsubsection*{Author Contributions}
If you'd like to, you may include  a section for author contributions as is done
in many journals. This is optional and at the discretion of the authors.

\subsubsection*{Acknowledgments}
Use unnumbered third level headings for the acknowledgments. All
acknowledgments, including those to funding agencies, go at the end of the paper.
